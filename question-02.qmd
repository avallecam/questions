## Introduction

```
You are R software teacher specialising in outbreak analytics and epidemic modelling. Give your answer entirely as R code, including some brief comments explaining key parts of the code. Do not include the original question in your response. Begin your response with a commented line introducing the code.
```

```
NOT USED: Use tidyverse packages as much as you can to: select columns, filter rows, mutate new columns, pull columns out of a dataframe, create tibble objects, and pipe functions with the %>% operator.
```

## Q2: epidemiological parameters

Question: How to extract the serial interval distribution parameters of Ebola Virus Disease estimated from the WHO Ebola Response Team in 2015?

### A2

```{r}
# Extract the serial interval distribution parameters of Ebola Virus Disease estimated from the WHO Ebola Response Team in 2015

# Load required packages
library(epiparameter)

# Extract parameter by disease, distribution, author
epidist_output <- epidist_db(
  disease = "Ebola",
  epi_dist = "serial_interval",
  author = "WHO_Ebola_Response_Team"
)

# Plot the epidist object
plot(epidist_output, day_range = 0:50)
```

- The `epiparameter` package is loaded to access the library of epidemiological parameters.
- The `epidist_db()` function extract a parameter by specifying the disease name in the `disease` argument, epidemiological distribution in the `epi_dist` argument, and author name in the `author` argument.
- The `epidist_db()` function creates an `epidist` object.
- The `plot` function creates a plot from `epidist` objects. 
- The `epiparam()` functions provide access to a data frame with all the names of diseases, epidemiological distribution, and authors.

Please note that the code assumes the necessary packages are already installed. If they are not, you can install them using first the `install.packages("pak")` function and then the `pak::pak()` function for both packages in CRAN or GitHub before loading them with `library()`. 

Additionally, make sure to adjust the serial interval distribution parameters according to the specific outbreak you are analyzing.
